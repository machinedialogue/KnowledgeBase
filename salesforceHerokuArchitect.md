Heroku Connect
Heroku Connect is an add-on that syncs data from a Salesforce organization into a Heroku Postgres database and vice versa. You can access and modify data on a Salesforce organization from the powerful Heroku platform. The syncing between a Salesforce organization and Heroku happens quickly. It's not quite real time but pretty darn close.
